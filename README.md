<h1 align="center">Cappadocia :airplane: :earth_africa: </h1>

This is a sample page of the Cappadocia tour. I'm self-taught, learning the frontend, so I could have done something wrong, or I could have done something better. 

The page layout was made using the layout from figma:(https://www.figma.com/file/bLlgvyYoDgMJvw6GO0Mp1e/%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80-(Copy)?node-id=14%3A65)
